# SCO-optimization
Search engine and Accessability Optimization
In this version of the HTMl file I started by updating the title to a more appropriate name.
The sites links have been redirected and corrected to maintain quality. Plus missing id issue for link has been fixed. 
I changed many Semantic elements so that they are a little more organized and up-to-date with current practices. 
Consolidated many Class names in each section to decrease on the repetitive declarations used in CSS. 
Removed numerous declarations due to redundancy.
Created a new repository and posted updated html and css files with folder to be shared on github. Also made repository live and avialable for public access.
